## Strings

A string is a sequence of characters. Many tips that apply to arrays also apply to strings.

Strings are defined as a stream of characters. Strings are used to represent text and are generally represented by enclosing text within quotes as: *"This is a sample string!"*

Different programming languages have different ways of declaring and using Strings. We will learn to implement strings in **Java**

In java, objects of String are immutable which means a constant and cannot be changed once created.

There are two ways to create string in Java:

- ***String literal***
    
    ```java
    String s = “GeeksforGeeks”;
    ```
    
- **Using *new* keyword**
    
    ```java
    String s = new String (“GeeksforGeeks”);
    ```
